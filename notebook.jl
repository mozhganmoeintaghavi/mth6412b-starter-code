# Introduction 

The initial phase of the project entails creating appropriate data structures for the symmetrical travelling salesman problem. In this project, only symmetric problems with weights in explicit format are considered.

The procedures and outputs of Phase 1 of the class project are documented in this report. The Julia programming language is used to create five files of: node.jl, edge.jl, graph.jl, main.jl, and read_stsp.jl.
The following sections go through all of the modifications in detail.

# An overview of what has been accomplished

We developed our code in the Phase 1 branch after considering the explicit weights in the symmetric problems. We have four significant files in our programme: node.jl, edge.jl, graph.jl, read stsp.jl, and main.jl. 

In terms of the nodes.jl file, we practically didn't modify this file from the original code. The name and data of each node can be derived from the node.jl file, and printed using the show function. We kept this file entirely as it was in the original code.

Also, we have defined the graphs with two parameters of: nodes and edges. 






The following are the main steps we have accomplished in this phase of the project:

1.  Having created an edge.jl file, an Edge type was introduced to denote the edges of a graph.

2. Having created the graph.jl file, we expanded the Graph type to include its edges. Considering the non-oriented graphs, we built the algorithm such that makes it possible for the user to add one edge to the graph.

3. We printed the edges of the graph between the starting and the ending nodes.
4. We activated the read_edges() function in the read_stsp.jl file to read the weights of the edges, and then computed the weights.

# The edge.jl file 

This file is said to be abstract type because we do not know about the input type, and was written in a similar manner as the node.jl file. The difference is that here, Node1 and Node2 are connected to the other two nodes.  We specifically set the starting node and the ending node, which indicate where the node begins and ends. 




In this code, we tried to break the edge to edgeNode1 , edgeNode2 to make it possible to read them faster in the future phases of the project, which would make it easier.






As a result, it defines the edge start and end, and then the edge's weight is determined. 


Finally, we can use the show function to output the edge by importing the node.jl file.







Here is the code snippet that we have included in the following after removing the comments and showing partial sections of the code we created:

```julia
import Base.show
include(\"node.jl\")

\"\"\" Abstract type from which other edge types will be derived.
\"\"\"
# abstract type AbstractEdge end

\"\"\"Type to representant the Edges of a graph

Exemple:

    #Old  edge1 = Edge(\"TO-MTL\",(1,2), 100 )
    #edge1= Edge((1,2), 100 ) 
    edge1= Edge(node1, node2, 50.1)



\"\"\"
mutable struct Edge 
  # node1::Node{K} # Start node 
  node1::AbstractNode #
  # node2::Node{K} # Finish node
  node2::AbstractNode #
  weight::Float64
end



edgeStart(edge) = name(edge.node1)

edgeEnd(edge) = name(edge.node2)

\"\"\"Renvoie les données contenues dans le noeud.
EN: Returns the weight contained in the edge \"\"\"
weight(edge) = edge.weight

\"\"\"Affiche un noeud.

end

```

# The read_stsp.jl file 

Here, we added a weight to the one in the original code, and added to tuple of edges.


(How we computed the weights?)
lines..... (flipped)







We tested this for the gr17 instance from the stsp file, and we were unable to plot it using the plot_graph() function since it does not allow us to execute, and there is no way for fixing it. We could, however, plot for the bayg29 instance that is provided in our assignment outputs. 









```julia
 while n_data > 0
          n_on_this_line = min(n_to_read, n_data)
          for j = start : start + n_on_this_line - 1
            weight = parse(Float64, data[j+1])
            n_edges = n_edges + 1
            if edge_weight_format in [\"UPPER_ROW\", \"LOWER_COL\"]
              edge = (k+1, i+k+2, weight)
            elseif edge_weight_format in [\"UPPER_DIAG_ROW\", \"LOWER_DIAG_COL\"]
              edge = (k+1, i+k+1, weight)
            elseif edge_weight_format in [\"UPPER_COL\", \"LOWER_ROW\"]
              edge = (i+k+2, k+1, weight)

              edge = (i+1, k+1, weight)

            else

# The graph.jl file 



we created the graph, and below is the example of how we can show the graph. Here, we defined an abstract variable T( like variable K in node.jl file) as a placeholder, and then we added an edge variable. Instead of using the two add_node!() and add_edge!() functions, we created the graph, and used the example to set node1, node2, node3, and also  edge1, and edge2. The purpose here was so that we may add or remove nodes and edges later on in the future phases of the project.

Then, for the graphs, we defined three functions of: names, nodes, and number of nodes. So, we can show the graph, and easily print each function for the number of nodes, and number of edges.

Finally, by reading the nodes and edges from the node.jl and edge.jl files, we can output the graph.






```julia

# The main.jl file 

To begin, this file imports all of the previous files that we have created.


Second, it reads a stsp file, switches the directory to the data file, and then allows us to select a graph name among several instances.
The nodes and edges of the graph are then created.

in the stsp file, some of the instances have the assigned name, and location while some of them are not assigned with values (like in gr17). So, in order to prevent from errors, we created a condition to check to see if the name is assigned in the stsp file. Otherwise, we assign a random name, and value to it ourselves.

array?......nodes list
edges list...location

Then, we went through the edge list and the edges of the graph were createed.

Finally, it generates the graph using data types and can display it using the graph name, edges list, and nodes list parameters. The final graph is shown in this step.

# Questions:

Question 1. When we look at several of the graphs, notably the gr17, we see that the weight between node 1 and node 2 is zero. The zero weights, on the other hand, are not visible in the graph (bayg29). We are puzzled on why this difference occurs among the instances.
